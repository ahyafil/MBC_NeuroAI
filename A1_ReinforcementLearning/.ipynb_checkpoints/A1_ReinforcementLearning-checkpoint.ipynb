    "# Part 2: Fitting RL Models - Understanding Human Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: Why Computational Modeling Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement and evaluate computational models of human decision-making. This is a crucial skill for understanding how people learn, make choices, and adapt their behavior based on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scientific Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a researcher studying how people learn to make optimal choices. You observe participants playing a simple game where they repeatedly choose between two slot machines with different (unknown) reward probabilities. Some participants learn quickly, others struggle. Some are cautious, others take risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The key question**: What cognitive strategies do people use to maximize their rewards? Are they using simple heuristics, sophisticated learning algorithms, or something in between?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Wilson & Collins Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the influential paper:\n",
    "**Wilson & Collins (2019) eLife: Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors provide a systematic approach to computational modeling that involves:\n",
    "1. **Model Construction**: Building mathematical models of cognitive processes\n",
    "2. **Parameter Estimation**: Finding the best-fitting parameters for each individual\n",
    "3. **Model Comparison**: Determining which model best explains the data\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Ensuring our methods are reliable and meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 2-Armed Bandit Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a classic experimental paradigm: the 2-armed bandit task. In this task:\n",
    "- Participants perform $T$ choices between two options (slot machines)\n",
    "- The machines have asymmetric reward probabilities: $\\mu_{1} = 0.2$ and $\\mu_{2} = 0.8$\n",
    "- These probabilities are **unknown** to the participant\n",
    "- The goal is to maximize total reward over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "1. **Understand** three different models of human decision-making\n",
    "2. **Implement** behavioral analyses to compare model predictions\n",
    "3. **Validate** your modeling approach using parameter recovery\n",
    "4. **Evaluate** model identifiability using model recovery\n",
    "5. **Apply** these techniques to understand real human behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bigger Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates fundamental principles of computational cognitive science. These methods are used to:\n",
    "- Understand psychiatric conditions\n",
    "- Evaluate educational interventions\n",
    "- Design better human-computer interfaces\n",
    "- Study neural mechanisms of learning and decision-making\n",

    "- **Mechanism**: If the last choice was rewarded → repeat it; if not → switch to the other option\n",
    "- **Randomness**: Occasionally explores randomly (parameter: $\\epsilon$)\n",

    "- **Real-world example**: Like a person who sticks with a restaurant if they had a good meal, switches if they had a bad meal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 2: **Rescorla-Wagner Learning**\n",
    "- **Core idea**: Sophisticated value learning based on prediction errors\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Maintains estimates of each option's value, updates based on reward prediction error\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Learning rate $\\alpha_{RW}$ (how fast you learn) and softmax temperature $\\beta_{RW}$ (how deterministic your choices are)\n",
    "- **Psychological insight**: Represents gradual learning and memory integration\n",
    "- **Real-world example**: Like carefully tracking your experiences with different restaurants and slowly updating your preferences\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Core idea**: Tendency to repeat recent actions regardless of outcomes\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Builds up \"momentum\" for recently chosen actions\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Kernel learning rate $\\alpha_{CK}$ and temperature $\\beta_{CK}$\n",
